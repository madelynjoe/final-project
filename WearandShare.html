I would always plan my outfits and take my time with them. To me, fashion is art. It is a way of showing people who you are, without actually telling them. It's another way of expressing yourself. Some people may like your style, other people may hate it, but in the end, it's you. </p></font size>

What inspired and motivated me was my interest for fashion. I believe fashion is a way to show an individual's style and expression. I like it because every person's fashion is different so it allows people to emphasize how everyone is unique in their own way.  Fashion gives people a sense of self confidence on how they present themselves in society. Fashion lets you show who you are.</p></font size>

To me fashion is so much more than just picking an outfit. At times I feel like I cannot express my feelings verbally so I try to project my feelings in some other way. Fashion is a great way to express who I am or how I’m feeling in that particular moment. The greatest thing I love about fashion is that no one wears a certain piece the same.
