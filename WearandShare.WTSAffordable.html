    <p style="border:2.5px; border-style:solid; border-color:white; padding: 1em;"><font size="20">THRIFTING</p></font size>

<p><strong>Why to consider thrifting:
</strong> Re-wearing clothes reduces waste and pollution. Second-hand clothes are less
likely to end up in landfills. Thrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going.
A thrift store is different from a consignment or resale shop. It is run by a not-for-profit group
instead of a merchant. The purpose of a thrift shop typically is to raise money for charities
via the not-for-profit group. Another great thing about thrifting is that you can find a unique
piece like nothing before. Going for a vintage style, try thrifting.
<br>
<strong> Thrifting Tips:</strong> Have an open mind! Buying used clothes can seem a little scary
but with a positive mindset you can find a really great piece. When thrifting it is always good to
look beyond your own style.
