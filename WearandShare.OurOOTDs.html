    <p><font size="3"> "Be yourself, everyone else is already taken," You may have already heard
  this quote in elementary school but it still lives on now. Everyone's sense
  of style is unique even when looking at each individual style of the creators
  of Wear & Share. Though Jessica, Ashley and Madelyn created Wear and Share
  with the same intentions, they all each express themselves differently. Each
  creator has shared there two personal favorite outfits. Each photo is also
  added with a description filled with details on the certain piece (links) as well as
  how the piece fits and feels. We have have also showed our favorite trends.</p></font size>

        <br><br><br><br><br><p>These outfits represent me because they both show my strong personality. Similar to the patterns and pop of color , I am bold and expressive. Usually, when I talk to people, the whole room can hear me and I have everyone’s attention. I say my mind in any situation and I am blunt when people ask me for my opinion. I am also a person who is confrontational when I am bothered. People’s opinions do not affect me and sometimes that can get me into trouble.</p></br></br></br></br></br>

          </div>
          <div class="column2" style="background-color:bisque;">
            <p>This summer outfit represents me because I love to pair jean shorts with tank tops on a warm day. Here I'm wearing plain light washed jeans and a blue criss cross top with lacing. Then, I added accessories including sunglasses and a pebble necklace to compliment the look. Finally, I finished the outfit wiht some sandals(sorry not shown).<p>&#x21E6;</p></p>
            <p>In this outfit, I paired a white crop top with a brown furry corduroy jacket on top. For the bottom, I wore high waist leggings with nike airs to stay comfortable throughout the day. I like this outfit because it is suitable for a cold or windy day while still being able to walk around throughout the day if wanted.<p> &#8680;</p></p>

            <div class="column2" style="background-color:bisque;">
            <br><br><br><br><p>These two outfits are pretty much my go-to's. Some staple pieces that I try to incorperate in every outfit are belts and some kind of large jacket. Sometimes I make up outfits in my head and they don't work out or I don't feel comfortable wearing it, so I just pop on an oversized jacket and I feel like myself again. My style is kind of weird and inconsitent, like me. I either dress up way too much or a little too casual, never in between.
